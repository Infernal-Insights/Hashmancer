# ðŸš€ Hashmancer Improvement Roadmap

## Quick Implementation Guide

### 1. Multi-GPU Scaling (Week 1)
```bash
# Add to darkling/src/main.cu
void detect_available_gpus() {
    int device_count;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&device_count);
    // Distribute workload across devices
}
```

### 2. Rule Effectiveness Tracking (Week 1)
```python
# Add to server/models/rule_analytics.py
class RuleAnalytics:
    def track_success_rate(self, rule_id, hits, attempts):
        # Store rule performance metrics
        pass
```

### 3. Smart Job Prioritization (Week 2)
```python
# Add to server/job_scheduler.py
class SmartScheduler:
    def prioritize_jobs(self, jobs):
        # Sort by deadline, user tier, estimated completion time
        pass
```

### 4. Cost Optimization (Week 2)
```python
# Add to server/cloud_manager.py
class CloudOptimizer:
    def choose_optimal_instance(self, job_requirements):
        # Select cheapest instance that meets performance needs
        pass
```

## Implementation Scripts

Run these to get started:
```bash
# Generate rule effectiveness report
./scripts/analyze-rule-performance.py

# Implement multi-GPU detection
./scripts/setup-multi-gpu.sh

# Deploy smart scheduler
./scripts/deploy-smart-scheduler.sh
```

## Success Metrics

Track these KPIs:
- **Hash rate per dollar** - Performance/cost optimization
- **Job completion rate** - Reliability improvement  
- **Rule effectiveness** - Intelligence enhancement
- **Resource utilization** - Efficiency gains
- **User satisfaction** - Overall experience
