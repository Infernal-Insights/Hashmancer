# Hashmancer

This repository contains two directories intended for the server and worker components:

- `Server` – should contain the [Hashmancer-Server](https://github.com/Infernal-Insights/Hashmancer-Server) project.
- `Worker` – should contain the [Hashmancer-Worker](https://github.com/Infernal-Insights/Hashmancer-Worker) project.

Due to environment restrictions, the submodules were not fetched automatically. Clone them manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Infernal-Insights/Hashmancer-Server Server
git clone https://github.com/Infernal-Insights/Hashmancer-Worker Worker
```
