# Darkling Rule Management System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
A comprehensive dual-architecture rule management system for the Darkling GPU password cracking engine, supporting both high-performance PTX-compiled built-in rules and flexible user-uploadable interpreted rules.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Rule Manager Core (`darkling_rule_manager.h`, `rule_manager.cu`)
- **Hybrid execution system**: Supports both PTX-optimized and interpreted rule execution
- **Built-in Best64 rules**: 64 most effective password transformation rules compiled to PTX
- **User rule support**: Runtime interpreted execution for user-uploaded rules
- **Memory management**: Efficient GPU memory allocation and kernel dispatch
- **Performance analysis**: Rule effectiveness tracking and optimization

### 2. PTX Rule Compiler (`ptx_rule_compiler.cpp`)
- **Hashcat rule conversion**: Converts hashcat rule syntax to optimized PTX assembly
- **Template-based generation**: Modular PTX code templates for different rule types
- **Automated compilation**: Integrated into build system for Best64 rule generation
- **Performance optimization**: Register optimization and memory coalescing

### 3. Rule Upload Handler (`rule_upload_handler.cpp`)
- **Security validation**: Prevents malicious rule injection and dangerous patterns
- **Syntax validation**: Comprehensive hashcat rule syntax checking
- **Complexity analysis**: Performance impact estimation and warnings
- **Format support**: Multiple rule file formats with auto-detection
- **Duplicate detection**: Identifies and warns about redundant rules

### 4. Best64 Rule Set (`rules/best64.rule`)
- **64 core rules**: Most effective password transformation patterns
- **Research-based**: Selected based on analysis of real password patterns
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Core transformations, leetspeak, appends, prepends, deletions

## Key Features

### Performance Optimization
- **PTX compilation**: Built-in rules compiled to native GPU assembly for maximum speed
- **Kernel fusion**: Hybrid execution kernel handles both PTX and interpreted rules
- **Memory efficiency**: Optimized memory access patterns and register usage
- **Batch processing**: Vectorized rule application across multiple words

### Security & Validation
- **Input sanitization**: Prevents shell injection and system access attempts
- **Resource limits**: Configurable limits on rule count and complexity
- **Syntax verification**: Strict adherence to hashcat rule specification
- **Performance bounds**: Warnings for computationally expensive rules

### Extensibility
- **Modular design**: Easy addition of new rule types and formats
- **Plugin architecture**: Support for custom rule processors
- **API compatibility**: C interface for integration with existing systems
- **Format flexibility**: Extensible rule file format support

## Implementation Details

### Rule Types Supported
- **Core transformations**: lowercase, uppercase, capitalize, reverse, duplicate
- **Character operations**: append, prepend, substitute, delete, insert
- **Position-based**: operations at specific character positions
- **Leetspeak**: common character substitutions (e->3, a->@, etc.)
- **Complex operations**: extraction, rotation, case inversion

### GPU Execution Model
```cuda
__global__ void hybrid_rule_execution_kernel(
    const uint8_t* input_words,
