## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (10 minutes)

### 1. 🔑 Get Your Anthropic API Key
```bash
# Visit: https://console.anthropic.com/
# Copy your API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here

# OR create .env file:
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual API key
```

### 2. 🧪 Run First Automated Analysis  
```bash
# Test connection
python3 test-opus-integration.py

# Run first security analysis
python3 scripts/opus-client.py --analysis-type security --max-fixes 2

# Apply fixes with testing
python3 scripts/opus-integration-starter.py
```

### 3. 🚀 Enable Full Automation (Optional)
```bash
# Add to GitHub Secrets for automated PRs:
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
# GITHUB_TOKEN

# Enable daily automated analysis in GitHub Actions
```
